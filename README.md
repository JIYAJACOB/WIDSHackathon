# WIDSHackathon
Motto :  Use data science to improve longer-range (longer-term) weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

This is an opportunity for data scientists to improve sub-seasonal forecasts by blending physics-based forecasts with machine learning. Sub-seasonal forecasts for weather and climate conditions (lead-times ranging from 15 to more than 45 days) would help communities and industries adapt to the challenges brought on by climate change.


Competition: Participants will submit forecasts of temperature and precipitation for one year, competing against the other teams as well as official forecasts from NOAA.


Target: Contest-tmp2m-14d__tmp2m : the arithmetic mean of the max and min observed temperature over the next 14 days for each location and start date, computed as (measured max temperature + measured mini temperature) / 2

NMME:  collection of physics-based forecast models from various modeling centers in North America
